## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Design with Flexbox: I learned how to use Flexbox to simplify the process of aligning and distributing elements within a container, making the design more fluid and flexible.

### Continued development

In future projects, I will focus on improving my advanced CSS skills, such as using CSS Grid to complement Flexbox and create more complex layouts. I also plan to refine my CSS coding practices by concentrating on modularity and implementing methodologies like BEM for better organization and maintainability. Additionally, I aim to delve into performance optimization techniques and ensure that my designs are fully responsive and accessible, applying best practices for web accessibility.
